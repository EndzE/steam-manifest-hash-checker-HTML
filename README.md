# Steam Manifest Hash Checker HTML

## Overview
The Steam Manifest Hash Checker is a simple, user-friendly tool that helps you verify your Steam game files. If you've ever wondered whether your game files are intact or need repair, this tool can help you check them against Steam's official data.

## Acknowledgments
- SteamKit2 code for reference implementation
- anadius for suggesting hash-wasm
- Masquerade for the original idea and testing

## AI Attribution Notice
This project was developed with partial assistance from Claude, an AI language model by Anthropic. The AI contributed to code optimization, implementation strategies, and documentation. The core functionality and original concept remain human-developed, with AI serving as a development aid for code refinement and feature implementation.

## Features
- Simple drag-and-drop interface
- Real-time checking progress
- Shows which files match, don't match, or are missing
- Multiple visual themes (Dark, Light, Blue, Steam, Synthwave, Ocean, Forest, Solarized)
- Folder visibility toggle
- Works with both Steam manifest files and SHA1 files
- Search function to find specific files
- Works directly in your browser - no installation needed
- Depot Name Lookup

## How to Use
1. Open the tool in your web browser
2. Drop your Steam manifest or SHA1 file into the left drop zone
3. Drop the folder containing your game files into the right drop zone
4. Watch the progress as it checks your files
5. Review the results:
   - ✓ Green check: File is good
   - ⚠ Red warning: File needs attention
   - ⌛ Orange clock: Still checking
   - 📁 Blue folder: Folder entry
